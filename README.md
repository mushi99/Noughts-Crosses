# Noughts-Crosses
=======

Noughts and Crosses is a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does. In this project, we built a Tic-Tac-Toe app on Android Studio, which has various modes to play.
